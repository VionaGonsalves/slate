#Parser Service

Parser service is a microservice framework that parses data in a defined format and stores it in database. The data can be in various input formats such as string or json which gets parsed into a standard format (key, value). Along with data parsing, enrichment of data such as date-time standardization, field conversion, format conversion is also done. After successfully parsing of data, parsed data gets stored in a database as well as produced into a messaging queue (Kafka).
